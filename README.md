Sentiment Analysis using BERT


The Sentiment Analysis using BERT project involves using a BERT model to analyze the sentiment of text data. This is done by preparing the data, including labeling it with sentiment labels, and tokenizing it using the BERT tokenizer. The data is then encoded in a specific format and the model is trained to recognize patterns associated with positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Finally, the model is used to perform sentiment analysis on new text data by encoding it and using the model to predict the sentiment label with the highest score.

Overall, the sentiment analysis using BERT project involves several steps, including data preparation, tokenization, encoding, model training, and inference, all aimed at accurately predicting the sentiment of textual data.
